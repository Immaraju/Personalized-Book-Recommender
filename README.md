Personalized Book Recommender

📌 Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a book recommendation system based on historical data to provide personalized book suggestions. The system aims to enhance the reading experience of users by recommending books that align closely with their preferences and interests.

🚀 Technologies Used

Python – Data processing and model development

Jupyter Notebook – Data analysis and experimentation

Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing

Cosine Similarity – To find the similarity between books

Pickle – Model serialization for efficient deployment

Streamlit – To create an interactive web application

📊 Dataset

The book dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains information such as:

Book titles, authors, and genres

User ratings and interactions

Book popularity metrics

🛠️ Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset using Pandas.

Feature Engineering: Using cosine similarity to compute book recommendations.

Model Training: Creating a recommendation model and saving it using Pickle.

Web Application: Implementing a Streamlit-based interactive UI where users can input book details and receive recommendations.

Deployment: The model and UI are integrated for seamless user experience.

🌟 Features
